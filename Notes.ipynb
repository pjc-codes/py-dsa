    "\n",
    "Two techniques :\n",
    "- **pointers move in the same direction** : this pattern usually shows up when you're doing a single pass over the data, but you need to track a range, not just one element at a time. A classic example is the fast and slow two-pointer setup. You'll often see one pointer moving one step at a time, which is the slow pointer, and another one moving faster, two steps at a time. Now, why would you ever do that? Well, it lets you detect patterns in a single pass. For example, if the fast pointer reaches the end while one is halfway, you found the middle. or if the fast pointer ever laps the slow pointer, you've detected a cycle.\n",
    "- **pointers move towards each other from opposite directions** : this is the more classic two-pointers implementation where one pointer starts at the beginning and the other starts at the end and they move inward. You'll see this pattern used when the array is sorted and you're trying to find a pair or combination. You're comparing symmetric parts of a structure like checking for palindromes or you want to avoid nested loops when looking at all pairs. Now, here's the mental model for this. Your left pointer starts at zero. Your right pointer starts at the last index. Then you check the current pair and based on some condition which is problem dependent. So it could be their sum or checking if the two characters match. You move one of the pointers inward. The condition is always problem specific, but this pattern is consistent. Opposite direction two pointers are especially powerful in sorted arrays because each time you move a pointer, you can eliminate an entire range of possibilities. Instead of checking all combinations, which would be $O(N^2)$, you're solving it in $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason two pointers are so powerful is:\n",
